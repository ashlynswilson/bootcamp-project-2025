          <p>
            During my time studying in Malaga, Spain, I discovered a whole new
            perspective on software development. From collaborating with
            international teams to learning about European tech practices, every
            day brought new insights. The Spanish approach to work-life balance
            and team dynamics has completely changed how I think about project
            management.
          </p>

          <h2>Cultural Differences in Tech</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most fascinating aspects of my study abroad experience
            was observing how different cultures approach software development.
            In Spain, I noticed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A stronger emphasis on team collaboration and communication</li>
            <li>
              More flexible working hours that promote creativity and
              productivity
            </li>
            <li>
              Integration of traditional siesta breaks into the development
              cycle
            </li>
            <li>Focus on sustainable development practices</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Learning in a New Environment</h2>
          <p>
            The university's approach to teaching technology was refreshingly
            different. Instead of focusing solely on technical skills, courses
            emphasized:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cross-cultural communication in tech teams</li>
            <li>Understanding global market needs</li>
            <li>Adapting to different development methodologies</li>
            <li>Building international professional networks</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <p>
            This experience has fundamentally changed how I approach software
            development. I've learned that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Different perspectives lead to better solutions</li>
            <li>Work-life balance improves code quality</li>
            <li>Cultural awareness is crucial in global tech teams</li>
            <li>Networking internationally opens new opportunities</li>
          </ul>
